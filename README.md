# FoodSnaps

FoodSnaps is a mobile application made during Hack Western 2022. The inspiration for this app came from a common problem many people face when it comes to meal planning and ingredient management - not knowing what to cook when you have limited ingredients available. Our goal was to make it easier for users to find recipes by lowering the friction of obtaining them. To achieve this, we implemented two input methods for finding recipes - using the camera to snap a picture of an ingredient and interacting with an AI chatbot to describe textually what you want to eat.

### Note : Navigate to nutrient-ai-identifier folder for react native app
